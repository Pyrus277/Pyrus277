## Hi, Iâ€™m @Pyrus277  
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
     Professionally, getting a junior level data engineering position where I can advance my skills as part of a team.   
     (Non-professionally, I'm big into tabletop games.) 
       
     Problem solving, espeically from a design perspective, sparks a specific kind of joy I increasingly can't get enough of, 
     and learning the list of skills involved with becoming a data engineer feeds into that perfectly.
       
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
       
     Lots of stuff. For a detailed breakdown, check out my website--http://pfoxtechcv.com  
       
     I recently graduated from the BrainStation data science bootcamp. It was an absolute blast, and went a long way in increasing the depth and breadth of my skills.   
     For the better part of the past decade I've been a bartender, which I loved, but feel like it's time to move on to something completely different.
