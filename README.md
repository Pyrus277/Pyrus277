- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Pyrus277
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...
     Professionally, becoming a data engineer. (Non-professionally, I'm big into tabletop games.) 
       
     Problem solving, espeically from a design perspective, sparks a specific kind of joy I increasingly can't get enough of, 
     and learning the list of skills involved with becoming a data engineer feeds into that perfectly. The job prospects keep me 
     doubly motivated. I'm also encouraged by knowing it's a field where you have to keep learning new things, so it won't
     likely get stale. I find that constantly learning is the best defense against elements that work to crush one's soul. such as 
     tedium and repetition. So far the journey has been a blast!

     Lots of stuff. Too much? I'm self taught with everything here. For the better part of the past decade I've been a bartender, 
     which I loved, and still love, but feel like it's time to move on to something completely different. A year ago I barely even knew 
     what a CPU was. Now I'm juggling Linux distros and listening to programming podcasts while I run and do dishes. 
     I find I learn much faster and am much more motivated to stick to a curriculum which I reasearched and put together for myself 
     instead of learning in a structured environment where others tell me what to do. I know many people are the exact opposite, but for 
     me I thrive off self determination. Having said that, however, I am certainly coachable and would love to have a mentor to bounce 
     ideas off of and go to when I really get stuck in a problem. It would also be nice to have someone to check in with to confirm I'm 
     going in the right direction with my learning--it's tough sometimes to not stray from the path and be lured in by all the shiny areas 
     of tech that are not so immedaitely relevant to DE. So yes, I look forward to breaking into the field and checking out meetups soon 
     to get the perspecive of experienced people. Very few people in my life even knew what a data engineer was before I told them about 
     it, so I feel I'm off on my own planet a lot of the time... I see I've digessed a somewhat, so here is a list of what I've got 
     going right now, broken down by areas of signficance ot DE...  

---Programming--Python---       
       
   -I've got the Coursera course Python of Everybody under my belt, and am on the home strech of the UMich Python 3 Specialization.
    Dr. Chuck of the former course actually turned me on to data engineering by virtue of the course being so data centric. 
              
   -I'm also working though a book of programming problem, the code of and details of which has a repsoitory on this very platform.
    Looking forward, once I'm done with the coursework of the specialization, I'm going to take a more project-oriented approach to 
    learning programming and working through that book is kind of a transition to that phase.
              
   -I also have it in mind to start learning a lower level programming language and have my sights set on Rust. 
            
---SQL, Databases, and Data Warehouses--
       
       
---Linux, Servers, and Shell Scripting---
       
---Logging, Monitoring, & Testing---
       
---Workflow---
       
---Big Data, Cloud, NoSQL---
